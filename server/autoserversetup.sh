# This aims script automates the setup of the Raspberry Pi server. It automagically installs
# python modules, packages, creates necessary folders, etc.

# Download (git clone) all the files from our GitHub 
git clone https://github.com/UVicRocketry/Hybrid-Test-Stand-Control /home/pi/Documents/htsc

# Make folder (mkdir) for log files generated by running the engine
mkdir /home/pi/Documents/logs

# Install (pip3) python3 module  phidget22 for stepper motor controller boards
pip3 install phidget22

# Create a cron job to automatically run startserver.sh after booting. Haven't figured out why it needs to be run twice
# to actually create the cron job.
echo "@reboot /home/pi/Documents/htsc/server/starthtsc.sh" | crontab -
echo "@reboot /home/pi/Documents/htsc/server/starthtsc.sh" | crontab -

# Delete autoserversetup.sh from home directory
